        "During the Python programming module, we have practiced manipulating data structures and types to gain an understanding into the fundamentals of python programming. Beginning from creating variables and functions, all the way to scraping the web and developing methodologies for working with lists, tuples, dictionaries and more. therefore, with both scripts, the first being a walk through and the second being a form of data manipulation to show some of the work developed while in this course that can be used in real scenarios when working in python. I decided that dictionaries and working with Census data in Pandas, would enable me to focus on some United States Geography but also show a couple of cool exercises anyone could do in their free time. Please feel free to confront these scripts with questions. \n",
        "\n",
        "The first script, focuses entirely with messing, breaking and manipulating a dictionary, and then evolving the dictionary throughout the process. The dicitonary is based on a list on Wikipedia, guessing the highest population cities in the United States. Due to the nature of the problem, I decided to make sure the dictionary would start with out of order key values, which will need to be replaced to keep the dictionary organized by the most populous cities. After changing and updating the values of the keys for the ten most populous cities, you're then tasked with testing to make sure that other cities or key values would be \"accurate\". If you for example put in Buffalo, it should not return that it's a part of the dictionary. After this exercise, the coder moves onto merging dictionaries together. By merging dictionaries and forcing the user to extend the dictionary to 15 cities rather than the first 10, it provides a new challenge of making sure everything properly funcitons and connects. By using a for loop, you can create this merge without a funciton, and then just having a larger overall dictionary. To keep it interesting, I noticed a large number of cities in Texas included in the top 15 most populous. So I added a way so that a user could remove the values from the dictionary pertaining to Texas. If this was organized by State and City rather than value and city, you could've just removed the Values of a certain state. However, I force the user to learn applying a few functions and using both the list and dictionary data types to update the dictionary. After Texas values were removed, a user should then test that the dicitonary is working by traversing the dictionary and ensuring that the values remain consistent. \n",
        "\n",
        "My second script despite it being short, was an attempt to make a process a bit shorter with less code. I went on medium to discover how to work with imported files locally in colab, which I could not do beforehand. I also used the pandas library to work with the dataframe, rather than the library used by the github page. I wanted to make this a short process, one where the user could clearly understand the process without having to filter through as maany components. This code, despite it being only a few lines, cuts out around 20 lines of code, and with small manipulation an end user could have this include census tract and county data without any added lines. The biggest challenge I had was pulling the data into colab, because I was not aware of how to do it from a local file, and the second was trying to condense it into fewer lines, where I looked on medium, stackoverflow and other resources for function calls in the pandas library that can condense the data in this matter. This felt very similar to working with dataframes in R, which made it more familiar for me. I am happy I have a functioning product that aligns in theme with the first script I had, but I honestly expected to need about 10 more lines than I used so I'm really proud of that.\n",
